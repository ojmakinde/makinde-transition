# Makinde Transition — Policy for Progress

A policy platform website focused on systemic solutions for education and healthcare equity, inspired by the design of [transition2025.com](https://www.transition2025.com/).

## Policy Areas

### Education
**Decouple School Funding from Property Taxes**

School funding tied to property taxes creates a cycle where poorer areas get worse schools. This policy redirects funding to ensure equitable distribution of resources regardless of zip code.

### Healthcare  
**Eliminate Employment-Based Access Barriers**

Black Americans face significant health disparities: 29% five-year heart attack mortality (vs 18% for White patients), the highest maternal mortality rate in the nation, and 2.4× infant mortality rates. This policy expands Medicaid and addresses healthcare access in underserved areas.
